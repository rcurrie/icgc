# ICGC CGT

Various scripts to start a set of [Cancer Gene Trust (CGT)](https://github.com/ga4gh/CGT)
servers, one for each ICGC country/institution, parse their respective public ICGC
submissions (somatic variant, expression, and clinical), and submit to
the associated CGT server. Primarily as a test bed for demos at the Vancouver GA4GH
as well as a test of the scalability of a set of CGT servers.
